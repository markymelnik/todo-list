# todo-list

12/16/2022

What is this?
  This is a web application that allows the user to create a "todo" item and display it to a friendly, intuitive user-interface. Each todo item, at minimum, will have a title, description, due date, and priority. These todo items will be organized into built-in lists, described as "all", "today", "scheduled", "starred", and "completed," as well as any custom lists made by the user. Todo items are stored internally and can be added/removed with ease. This application is very similar to the Reminder application on iOS.
